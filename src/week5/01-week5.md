# Introduction to Data Science & Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) allows computers to learn patterns and make decisions from data, rather than being explicitly programmed. ML is essential in the era of Big Data and modern AI.

## Key Concepts

- **Traditional Computing vs ML:** Traditional computing relies on programmed rules; ML builds its own models from data.
- **Types of ML:**
    - *Supervised:* Predictive tasks (regression & classification) using labeled data.
    - *Unsupervised:* Descriptive tasks (clustering, summarization, association) without predefined labels.
    - *Reinforcement:* Learning from trial-and-error feedback.
- **Modeling:** ML algorithms induce functions or hypotheses to solve problems.
- **Tools:** Scikit-Learn provides ready-to-use ML algorithms for various tasks.

- **Workflow:** Preprocess data → Train model → Test/validate model.

ML is about creating models that generalize from data to make predictions or uncover hidden patterns efficiently.

- Overfitting: The model learns the training data too well, including its noise. It performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
- Underfitting: The model is too simple and fails to learn the underlying pattern. It performs poorly on both training and new data.
