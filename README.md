A repository to document my weekly progress, notes, and projects for my Introduction to Data Science course.


### Scikit-learn Library
Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library that supports both supervised and unsupervised learning.
It provides tools for model tuning, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, among other utilities.
Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
Later in this course, weâ€™ll explore Machine Learning in depth, and Scikit-learn will be the main library for all our implementations.

### Mastering Data Visualization

Mastering the art of visualization takes practice â€” there are many strategies to do it well!  
Understanding the purpose of each chart type and knowing how to best visualize your data is a key differentiator for data science professionals.

Have you checked out the **Data Viz Project**?  
Itâ€™s a great resource to explore which types of charts work best for different situations.

### Matplotlib and Seaborn

- **Matplotlib** is one of the most complete plotting libraries and serves as the foundation for many others. However, it often requires more manual setup through code.
- **Seaborn**, on the other hand, comes with smart defaults that automatically adapt to your data â€” making it easier to use and visually more appealing.
